### :name_badge: Project name come from?

The project name come from the children book, titled "[Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see?](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BZS8RS9)" by Bill Martin, Jr. and Eric Carle.

I read the book to my child many times by her request.
The purple cat is the most favorit character of her.
